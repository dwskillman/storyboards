Storyboard for Information Security Motion Graphic Animation:

**Scene 1: "Information Classification Overview"**

*Opening Shot:* A digital world map with the Wells Fargo logo hovering above it, symbolizing the global presence of the company.

1. The camera zooms in on the Wells Fargo logo, and it dissolves into a flow of digital data streams.

2. Text appears on the screen: "In this video, we'll discuss how Wells Fargo classifies information."

**Scene 2: "Risk-Based Information Classification"**

*Transition:* Transition from the data streams to a vertical ascending scale representing risk levels.

1. The camera pans up along the ascending scale, with text labels representing each risk level: "Lowest Risk," "Higher Risk," "High Risk," "Highest Risk."

2. Icons representing information types (public, internal-use, confidential, restricted) appear and move up the scale, each labeled with its respective risk level.

3. The camera focuses on the icons as they move upward to visually represent the concept that "the more sensitive the information, the higher the risk."

**Scene 3: "Public Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "Lowest Risk" section of the scale.

1. The camera zooms in on a section labeled "Public Information," and icons representing Wells Fargo branch and ATM locations, as well as marketing materials, emerge.

2. A transparency effect is applied to these icons, illustrating that public information has no restrictions.

**Scene 4: "Internal-Use Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "Higher Risk" section of the scale.

1. The camera moves to the "Higher Risk" section, and icons representing home and email addresses, policy numbers, and Wells Fargo policies appear.

2. Icons have a semi-transparent shield around them, indicating that they are accessible to those with a business need to know.

**Scene 5: "Confidential Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "High Risk" section of the scale.

1. The camera focuses on the "High Risk" section, where icons symbolizing sensitive company correspondence and data encryption appear.

2. An animation shows confidential information icons encased in a digital lock to convey the need for encryption when sending outside the Wells Fargo network.

3. Examples of confidential information (Wells Fargo demographics, birthdates, etc.) are highlighted.

**Scene 6: "Restricted Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "Highest Risk" section of the scale.

1. The camera moves to the "Highest Risk" section, and icons representing PIN numbers, passwords, and CVV (Card Verification Value) codes appear.

2. These icons are enclosed in a robust digital fortress, symbolizing their high level of security.

3. A warning sign flashes, indicating that unauthorized disclosure or destruction of restricted information can have severe consequences.

**Scene 7: "Responsibility and Guidelines"**

*Transition:* Zoom out from the scale and return to the Wells Fargo logo.

1. The camera zooms out to reveal the entire risk scale, with all four information types labeled at their respective levels.

2. Text appears: "We are all responsible for following business policies and guidelines for classifying information."

3. A final message appears: "Know the risks involved with handling each type of information."

4. The animation ends with the Wells Fargo logo and a call to action, encouraging viewers to learn more about information security policies.

This storyboard, combined with dynamic animations and transitions, effectively conveys the importance of information classification and security at Wells Fargo.
