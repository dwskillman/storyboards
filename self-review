Robbery:
1. I'm proud to highlight my role as an Instructional Designer in the development of the training course, Robbery Procedures. One of my key contributions to this project was the creation of custom 3D characters and environments, which played a pivotal role in enhancing the overall learning experience. Leveraging my expertise in 3D design, I meticulously crafted characters and environments that not only looked visually stunning but also effectively conveyed the essential concepts of the course. These custom assets brought an immersive element to the training, enabling learners to engage with and understand robbery procedures in a more tangible and memorable way. This initiative exemplified my commitment to delivering high-quality, innovative training solutions that ultimately benefited our organization and its employees.
2. In my role as an Instructional Designer, I was faced with a unique challenge during the development of the training courses for Robbery Procedures and Branch Open and Close Procedures. Despite being added to the project relatively late in its development, I was determined to make a meaningful impact. Initially, we had planned to create custom 3D characters and environments to enhance the training experience. However, due to time constraints and unforeseen obstacles, we had to pivot to using static 3D images instead. Despite this setback, I approached the situation with adaptability and creativity. I meticulously designed and integrated static 3D images into the courses, ensuring they were not only visually engaging but also aligned with the learning objectives. This adaptation not only saved valuable time but also maintained the effectiveness of the training materials. I'm proud of my ability to think on my feet and find innovative solutions to challenges, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.
