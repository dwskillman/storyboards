Robbery:
1. I'm proud to highlight my role as an Instructional Designer in the development of the training course, Robbery Procedures. One of my key contributions to this project was the creation of custom 3D characters and environments, which played a pivotal role in enhancing the overall learning experience. Leveraging my expertise in 3D design, I meticulously crafted characters and environments that not only looked visually stunning but also effectively conveyed the essential concepts of the course. These custom assets brought an immersive element to the training, enabling learners to engage with and understand robbery procedures in a more tangible and memorable way. This initiative exemplified my commitment to delivering high-quality, innovative training solutions that ultimately benefited our organization and its employees.
2. In my role as an Instructional Designer, I was faced with a unique challenge during the development of the training courses for Robbery Procedures and Branch Open and Close Procedures. Despite being added to the project relatively late in its development, I was determined to make a meaningful impact. Initially, we had planned to create custom 3D characters and environments to enhance the training experience. However, due to time constraints and unforeseen obstacles, we had to pivot to using static 3D images instead. Despite this setback, I approached the situation with adaptability and creativity. I meticulously designed and integrated static 3D images into the courses, ensuring they were not only visually engaging but also aligned with the learning objectives. This adaptation not only saved valuable time but also maintained the effectiveness of the training materials. I'm proud of my ability to think on my feet and find innovative solutions to challenges, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.

RSFE:
1. As an Instructional Designer, I took great pride in my ability to create effective and visually appealing course content. One of my standout achievements was the creation of a custom infographic for the topic of referring suspected financial exploitation of vulnerable adults. I meticulously crafted this infographic to not only convey critical information but also to engage and educate our learners effectively. What makes this accomplishment even more special is that the infographic seamlessly adhered to the Wells Fargo brand standards, maintaining a cohesive and professional look and feel throughout our training materials. This infographic served a dual purpose – it was not only an integral part of our course content but also a valuable standalone resource that our learners could reference independently. It's my commitment to quality and attention to detail that allowed me to deliver this project successfully, enhancing the overall learning experience and aligning it with our organization's branding standards.

Product Academy:
1. I'm thrilled to share one of the highlights of my role as an Instructional Designer – the creation of an animated motion graphic illustrated video for Product Academy. This project allowed me to blend my passion for design and instructional expertise seamlessly. I approached it with enthusiasm and creativity, ensuring that the video not only conveyed the necessary information but also captured the attention of our audience. From conceptualizing the storyboard to animating the graphics, I was involved in every step of the process, and I'm proud of the final result. This video not only brought our training materials to life but also made the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable for our learners. It's exciting to see how my skills as an instructional designer can have a tangible impact, and I'm looking forward to more opportunities to bring creativity into our training initiatives.
