### Successes and Achievements:

This year has been marked by several notable successes and achievements, showcasing the quality and impact of the work produced.

One standout project was the creation of the Consumer, Small & Business Banking (CSBB) college videos. Using Adobe Illustrator and After Effects, I developed a software explainer video that guided users through the CSBB College website functionality. The seamless blend of illustrated website mockups, screenshots, and illustrated vectors provided a clear and engaging user experience. This project excelled not only in its visual appeal but also in its functional clarity, achieved through meticulous planning and execution.

Another significant accomplishment was the development of 15 to 20 illustrations for Electronic and Digital Communications. These illustrations depicted various aspects of policies and procedures, with each of the three lines of business represented by a different color scheme. This differentiation enhanced visual clarity and alignment with each business line’s identity. The success of this project lay in maintaining consistency while tailoring content to specific needs, demonstrating adaptability and attention to detail. This achievement was facilitated by a thorough understanding of each business line’s requirements and close collaboration with stakeholders.

The production of two brand videos was also a major success. Using Illustrator, After Effects, and Premier Pro, I created vector animated videos with animated illustrations, voice over, and background music. The first video explained Wells Fargo’s Sonic brand, detailing how to use brand music and external voice over talent. The second video outlined brand photography standards, uses, and best practices. These videos were highly successful due to their clear messaging and engaging presentation, achieved through a combination of creative storytelling and technical proficiency.

Lastly, the Accessibility Canada video was a noteworthy achievement. This project involved creating an illustrated animated video to explain the need for accessibility and Wells Fargo's compliance initiatives. The video effectively communicated complex accessibility standards in an easy-to-understand and visually engaging format. This success was achieved through detailed research, thoughtful illustration, and precise animation, ensuring the content was both informative and accessible.

Overall, these projects highlight a year of strong performance, marked by high-quality outputs, effective use of tools, and a consistent focus on clarity and engagement. Each project not only met its objectives but also demonstrated a commitment to excellence in both execution and outcome.


Moving forward, there are several areas where additional progress is needed. One key area of focus will be enhancing the interactivity and user engagement of our video content. Exploring new tools and techniques in Adobe Creative Suite could provide opportunities to incorporate more dynamic elements into future projects. Additionally, there is a need to streamline the production process for illustrations and animations, potentially by developing templates or style guides that can expedite project timelines while maintaining high-quality output.

Another area of focus will be deepening my understanding of accessibility standards and best practices. With the growing emphasis on digital accessibility, it will be crucial to stay abreast of the latest guidelines and technologies to ensure all our digital content is fully compliant and user-friendly.


This year, managing risk overlay expectations was a critical focus, ensuring all projects adhered to compliance and quality standards. For the Consumer, Small & Business Banking (CSBB) college videos, I meticulously followed brand guidelines and conducted regular reviews and quality checks to address potential issues early. In the Electronic and Digital Communications illustrations project, I regularly consulted with stakeholders from each business line and implemented a rigorous feedback loop to ensure accuracy and minimize errors. For the brand videos explaining Wells Fargo’s Sonic brand and photography standards, I worked closely with the branding team and conducted regular check-ins to maintain compliance. The Accessibility Canada video involved extensive research and consultation with experts and individuals with disabilities to accurately communicate complex accessibility standards. Overall, I managed and mitigated risks through thorough review processes, stakeholder engagement, and detailed research. This approach ensured all projects were delivered to the highest standards and reinforced the reliability of the work.


In summary, this year has been highly productive, with several key accomplishments in creating engaging and visually appealing video and illustration content. The CSBB college videos, Electronic and Digital Communications images, brand videos, and Accessibility Canada video were all significant achievements that showcased a range of skills and tools. Moving forward, the focus will be on enhancing user engagement, streamlining production processes, and deepening expertise in accessibility standards. The strong adherence to risk overlay expectations further underscores a commitment to quality and compliance, laying a solid foundation for continued success and improvement in the coming year.
