**Scene 4: Private Conversations**

- *Transition In*: Show a close-up of two people having a conversation in a public area.

- *Visuals*: Indicate the importance of privacy with a "private" sign appearing nearby, separating the conversation from the public area.

**Scene 5: Proper Document Disposal**

- *Transition In*: Show an office desk with documents scattered around.

- *Visuals*: Display a hand picking up a document and placing it into a secured shred bin.

**Conclusion: Prioritize Information Security**

- *Transition In*: Fade in from black to a close-up of a person's face looking thoughtful.

- *Visuals*: Display icons representing various security elements (e.g., email, password, locked computer, private conversation, shredder) surrounding the person's face.

- *Animation*: The icons glow to indicate security awareness.

- *Transition Out*: Fade to black with a call to action or a message about the importance of information security.
