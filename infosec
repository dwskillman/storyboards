Storyboard for Information Security Motion Graphic Animation:

**Scene 1: "Types of Information"**

*Opening shot:* A blank screen.

1. As the animation begins, the screen slowly fills with various types of information icons such as documents, envelopes, credit cards, and computer screens. Each icon represents different types of information Wells Fargo handles.

2. The camera then zooms in on these icons, and they start to come to life, with data flowing through them like currents of information.

3. Cut to a magnifying glass that appears in the frame, moving around and inspecting different pieces of information. This symbolizes the close monitoring by government authorities.

4. The camera gradually zooms out, revealing a larger perspective with three major categories: "Personal Information," "Non-Public Personal Information," and "Cardholder Information" prominently displayed.

**Scene 2: "Personal Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "Personal Information" category.

1. The scene transitions to a laptop screen, where we see a fictitious employee's profile page being displayed. The employee's name, photo, and basic information (e.g., age, location) are visible.

2. Icons representing various forms of personal information (e.g., driver's license, passport, social media logos, contact info) start building around the laptop screen, forming a circle.

3. As each piece of personal information is added, it lights up and becomes more detailed. For example, a social media icon could show a stream of posts, a contact info card could display an address book, and so on.

4. The camera gradually pans out, revealing that all these pieces of information are interconnected like a web, emphasizing the concept that one piece alone may not identify an individual, but when combined, they create a complete profile.

5. A "Identification" icon or symbol appears in the center of the screen, pulsating to indicate that the fictitious employee's identity has been established through the combination of these details.

**Scene 3: "Non-Public Personal Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "Non-Public Personal Information" category.

1. The scene transitions to a secure vault-like environment, symbolizing the protection of sensitive data. A large, ornate safe door swings open, revealing a stack of documents labeled "Non-Public Personal Information."

2. These documents start to glow with a subtle aura of importance. Some of them display social security numbers, tax identification numbers, and financial statements.

3. An animation shows these documents being surrounded by a protective shield, emphasizing the security required for this type of information.

4. As the camera zooms in on the documents, text appears to explain the legal aspect: "Protected by Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act."

5. A "Wells Fargo Information Security Policy Program" document appears, emphasizing the institution's commitment to safeguarding this data.

**Scene 4: "Cardholder Information"**

*Transition:* Zoom into the "Cardholder Information" category.

1. The scene transitions to a stylized credit card design. The cardholder's name, account number, expiration date, and Card Verification Value (CVV) are prominently displayed.

2. The camera then moves to reveal a representation of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) logo, emphasizing the importance of compliance.

3. A digital fortress with the Wells Fargo logo emerges around the credit card, symbolizing the layers of security in place.

4. A hacker silhouette approaches the fortress but is repelled by digital barriers and shields, showcasing the protective measures in place to prevent risks to Wells Fargo customers.

**Transition Out:**

1. The animation gradually zooms out, encompassing all three categories (Personal, Non-Public Personal, Cardholder Information) once more, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of Wells Fargo's information security.

2. The three categories are interconnected, showcasing the importance of securing each type of information within the broader context of information security.

3. The final scene fades out with a tagline: "Securing Your Information, Securing Your Trust."

4. The animation ends with the Wells Fargo logo and a call to action, encouraging viewers to learn more about the bank's information security measures.
